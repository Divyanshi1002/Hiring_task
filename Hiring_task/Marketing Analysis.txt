Feature Importance in Predicting Total Sales
Based on the Random Forest Regression model, the features impacting total sales (TOT_SALES) are ranked as follows:
  

   1. PROD_QTY (Most Important): The number of products purchased is the strongest predictor of total sales.
Bulk-buy promotions could increase revenue by encouraging customers to purchase more.
   2. PURCHASE_FREQUENCY (Second Most Important): Frequent purchases are a significant driver of total sales.
Loyalty programs and personalized promotions could boost repeat purchases, enhancing sales.
   3. TIME_SINCE_FIRST_PURCHASE: The length of time a customer has been shopping with the company affects sales, though less than product quantity or purchase frequency.
Loyal customers may contribute more in the long run, but new customers can also be engaged with targeted offers.
   4. LIFESTAGE_ENC (Demographic Influence): A customer's lifestage impacts sales, though to a lesser extent than purchasing behavior.
Tailored marketing strategies based on lifestage preferences can improve sales.
   5. PREMIUM_CUSTOMER_ENC (Least Important): Being a premium customer has the least impact on total sales.
Reassess the premium customer program to ensure it drives higher spending.
